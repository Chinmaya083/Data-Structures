# Data-Structures

These are my implementations of some data structures such as linked list, queue etc. 
Operations such as inserting at the begining, inserting at nth position, deleting etc., have been included in the files.
Use void main() to play with your own sample cases.
Some Hackerearth problems have been implemented using python.
